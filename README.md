# Ferns and Petals Sales Analysis

## Overview

This sales analysis project provides a comprehensive view of FNP’s business performance using 1,000 customer orders from 2023. The dashboard consolidates key metrics—total revenue, order volume, average customer spending, and delivery time—while breaking down sales by occasion, product category, time, month, and geography. The goal is to help leadership quickly identify revenue drivers, seasonal trends, and customer behavior to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Total Orders: 1,000
- Total Revenue: ₹35,20,984
- Average Customer Spend: ₹3,520.98 per order
- Average Order-to-Delivery Time: 5.53 days
These KPIs reflect a solid revenue stream with moderate order volumes and relatively quick delivery turnaround.

## Revenue Insights

- By Occasion: Anniversary and Raksha Bandhan contribute the highest revenues (₹6–7 lakh range), while Diwali and Valentine’s Day generate moderate revenue (₹3–4 lakh). This indicates strong demand during personal/family occasions.
- By Product Category: Colors lead with ~₹10 lakh revenue, followed by Soft Toys and Sweets (₹6–7 lakh). Cake, Plants, and Mugs are smaller contributors, highlighting potential upselling/cross-selling opportunities.
- Top Products: “Magman Set” drives the highest individual product revenue (>₹1.2 lakh), followed by “Dolores Gift” and “Deserunt Box” (~₹1 lakh each).
- By Month: Peak revenue is observed in February and August (₹7 lakh+), likely coinciding with Valentine’s Day and Raksha Bandhan. Revenue dips in May–July and October–December, pointing to off-season periods where promotional campaigns could boost sales.
- By Hour (Order Time): Orders and revenue spike between 6:00 and 10:00 hrs and again at 18:00–20:00 hrs, suggesting optimal windows for marketing pushes or flash deals.

## Geographic Performance

The top 10 cities by order volume show Imphal, Dibrugarh, and Kewal as leading markets (25–30 orders each). Other cities like Bharara and Bidhanagar are smaller but consistent. This indicates potential to tailor city-specific promotions or logistics optimization.

## Actionable Insights

- Focus marketing efforts on Anniversary and Raksha Bandhan seasons to maximize returns.
- Expand or promote high-performing categories like Colors, Soft Toys, and Sweets.
- Explore customer engagement during low-revenue months (e.g., targeted discounts in June/October).
- Leverage peak ordering times with push notifications or time-limited offers.
- Analyze high-order cities for localized campaigns and delivery partnerships.

## Conclusion

The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor performance, identify sales drivers, and act on emerging trends. By leveraging these insights, FNP can optimize product mix, marketing strategy, and operational efficiency to drive higher revenue and customer satisfaction.
